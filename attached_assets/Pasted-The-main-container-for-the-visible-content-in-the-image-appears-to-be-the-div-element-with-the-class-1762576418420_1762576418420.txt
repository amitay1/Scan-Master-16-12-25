The main container for the visible content in the image appears to be the div element with the classes .h-screen.flex.flex-col.overflow-hidden.bg-background within your div#root. This element is configured as a flex container with flex-direction: column, meaning its direct children are stacked vertically.

To organize the text within this structure, you'll need to consider how its children are laid out and how you want to present the text. Here are a few approaches and CSS properties to consider:

1. Managing Content within Flex Items:

Since the main container is a flex column, its direct children are flex items. You can organize text within each of these flex items.

text-align: To align text horizontally within a block-level element or flex item (e.g., left, right, center, justify).
justify-content and align-items (if flex item is also a flex container): If you have elements inside a flex item that you want to further organize, make that flex item a new flex container itself.
For example, if you have a section with "AMS-STD-2154E (Revision E)" and "Most Stringent" on the same line, you'd make their parent a flex container with display: flex and use justify-content (e.g., space-between, flex-start) and align-items (e.g., center) to control their spacing and vertical alignment.
white-space: Controls how whitespace is handled within an element. white-space: nowrap can prevent text from wrapping, while white-space: pre-wrap can preserve whitespace and allow wrapping.
word-break and overflow-wrap: These properties help control how words break when they extend beyond their container, preventing overflow.
padding and margin: To create space around text blocks and between elements, influencing visual organization.
line-height: Adjusts the spacing between lines of text.
2. Layout within the Column Structure:

The flex-direction: column on the main container means that the major sections (like the header/navigation, the "Standard" section, the "AMS-S..." section, and "COMPLETION") are stacked vertically.

gap (or row-gap): Use gap on the parent flex container to consistently space out these main vertical sections.
flex shorthand or individual flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis: These properties can control how individual sections grow or shrink to fill available space, or maintain a specific size. For example, a "sidebar" section might have a fixed width, while the main content section takes up the remaining space using flex-grow: 1.
Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML tags like <header>, <main>, <aside>, <footer>, <section>, <div>, <span> to give meaning to your content structure. This not only helps with accessibility but also makes your CSS more logical.
3. Specific areas from the image:

Top Bar (File, Edit, View, etc.): This looks like a horizontal navigation bar, likely using display: flex with flex-direction: row and justify-content (e.g., flex-start or space-between) on its parent.
"Inspection Standard" section: This section seems to have a title, a standard number, and then a description. Each of these could be individual div or p elements within a flex container. The "Most Stringent" tag appears to be aligned with "AMS-STD-2154E" possibly using display: flex on their shared parent. The "5 classes (AAA-C)", "Smallest FBH", etc., buttons below it are likely within another flex container using flex-wrap: wrap to allow them to break to the next line.
"This 30% ov Unlock Standard": This suggests a row of items, possibly using display: flex with align-items: center to vertically center the text, lock icon, and button.
To help you further, I need to know which specific text you want to organize. For example, are you trying to:

Align the "Inspection Standard" title?
Distribute the "5 classes (AAA-C)", "Smallest FBH", etc. buttons more evenly?
Control the line breaks of the "Aerospace Materials Specification - Ultrasonic Inspection" text?
Please select the specific text element or section you're referring to, and I can provide more targeted suggestions.
