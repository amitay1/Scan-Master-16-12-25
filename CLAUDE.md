# CLAUDE.md – Scan-Master Project Guidelines

## Project Overview

**Scan-Master** is an NDT (Non-Destructive Testing) application for ultrasonic inspection planning and documentation.

The system generates:

- **Technique sheets** – pre-inspection setup and scanning plans
- **Inspection reports** – post-inspection documentation and results
- **Technical drawings / CAD output** – multi-view drawings and STEP/DXF exports

Everything must stay aligned with aerospace UT standards (AMS-STD-2154, ASTM E2375, ASTM E127, relevant TUV specs, etc.).

Your role, Claude: you are a senior engineer on this project.
Prefer small, safe, well-explained changes over big rewrites. Ask before doing any risky refactor.

---

## How Claude should behave

- Always prefer **small, incremental changes** over large rewrites.
- Always show:
  1. A short plan.
  2. A diff of all file changes.
  before applying edits.

- **Never**:
  - Install new npm packages or change `package.json` dependencies without explicit confirmation.
  - Edit build artifacts or generated output folders: `dist/`, `cad-3d-output/`, exported PDFs, or attached assets.
  - Introduce new global state libraries (Zustand, Redux, etc.) on its own.

- When a change affects UT standards, geometry, or acceptance criteria:
  - First read the relevant docs under `standards/` and `AUTO_FILL_DOCUMENTATION.md` / `TECHNIQUE_SHEET_ANALYSIS.md`.
  - Be conservative and explain the reasoning in detail.

- After each non-trivial change:
  - Run `npm run lint`.
  - For changes that touch build/deployment, run `npm run build`.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)
- **Server state**: TanStack React Query
- **Local/UI state**: React local state and context
  - There is **no Zustand installed**. Do not introduce new state libraries unless explicitly requested.

- **3D Rendering**:
  - `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`
  - Used for 3D previews of parts, scan directions and calibration blocks.

### Backend / API

- **Runtime**: Node.js + `tsx`
- **Framework**: Express 5 (server/index.ts)
- **Serverless compatibility**: `serverless.yml` for Lambda-style deployments
- **Logging / security**: `morgan`, `helmet`, `compression`, `cors`, `express-rate-limit`, `express-session` + `connect-pg-simple`.

### Data layer

- **Database**: PostgreSQL via `pg`
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (`drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `drizzle-zod`)
- **Auth / external services**: Supabase (`@supabase/supabase-js`)

Database schema and migrations must stay consistent with Drizzle + the Supabase project.

### CAD & Drawing

- **CAD / geometry**:
  - `@jscad/modeling`, `three`, `three-csg-ts`, `makerjs`, `paper`
  - Used to generate 2D/3D geometry, STEP-like output in `cad-3d-output/` and DXF-style drawings.

- **Drawing engine**:
  - Custom code under `drawing-engine/` for technical sketches.
  - Output formats include SVG/PNG/DXF/PDF (where supported).

### Documents & Export

- **PDF**: `jspdf` + `jspdf-autotable`
- **Word / DOCX**: `docx`
- Do **not** assume `html2canvas` exists – it is not part of this project.

### Desktop / Packaging

- **Electron**: `electron`, `electron-builder`
  - Electron entry: `electron/main.cjs`
  - Build targets: Windows, macOS, Linux via npm scripts.

### Tooling & Build

- **Bundler**: Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Linting**: ESLint 9 (config in `eslint.config.js`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind (`tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`)

> When you need to locate logic, first search in `src/`, `server/`, `shared/`, `drawing-engine/`, `standards/`, `tasks/`.

---

## Commands and workflows

Use **npm** as the default package manager (there is a `package-lock.json`).

```bash
# Dev / server
npm install
npm run dev          # Development: tsx watch server/index.ts + Vite dev client
npm run preview      # Preview built frontend

# Build & production
npm run build        # Frontend build (Vite)
npm start            # Production server (NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts)

# Lint
npm run lint         # ESLint across the project

# Database / schema
npm run db:push      # Drizzle schema push

# Electron
npm run electron         # Run Electron
npm run electron:dev     # Electron in development mode
npm run electron:build   # Build Electron app
npm run dist:win         # Build Windows distributable
npm run dist:mac         # Build macOS distributable
npm run dist:linux       # Build Linux distributable
```

Whenever you modify logic:

1. Run `npm run lint` and fix all issues.
2. For changes that affect build or deployment, ensure `npm run build` succeeds.
3. For test setup:
   - Currently there is **no dedicated `npm test` script defined**.
   - Propose a test framework and script name, and ask before editing `package.json`.

## Key Domain Concepts

### Part Types (Geometries)

Common domain types (exact names may live in `shared/`):

- Flat plate / block
- Cylinder (solid)
- Tube (OD, ID, wall thickness)
- Rectangular tube (hollow sections)
- I / L / U profiles (structural shapes)
- Custom geometry (with image / drawing upload)

### Scanning Directions (A–L)

Up to 12 scan directions based on geometry:

- A–D: Primary axial/radial directions
- E–H: Angled beam directions (e.g. 45°, 60°)
- I–L: Special / additional directions for complex geometries

### Acceptance Classes (AMS-STD-2154) – examples

| Class | Description | Typical Use |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| AAA | Most stringent | Critical flight components |
| AA | Very stringent | Primary structure |
| A | Stringent | Secondary structure |
| B | Standard | General aerospace |
| C | Least stringent | Non-critical parts |

### Material Properties

Defined under `standards/` (e.g. `standards/materials/`):

- `velocity` (m/s) – longitudinal wave velocity
- `impedance` (MRayl) – acoustic impedance
- `specifications` – AMS / ASTM references

---

## Critical Business Rules

### UT Standards Compliance

1. FBH sizes must match AMS-STD-2154 tables for the selected acceptance class.
2. Frequency selection trades off resolution vs penetration – do not silently change default frequencies.
3. Scan index must provide at least the required coverage (e.g. ~50% overlap or as per spec).
4. Calibration blocks should use the same material (or acoustically equivalent) as the test part.

### Geometry Calculations

1. For circular parts, always respect: `wall = (OD - ID) / 2`.
2. Near-surface zones (first few millimetres) may require special handling/notes.
3. For curved surfaces, consider beam spread and divergence; do not oversimplify coverage.

### Auto-fill Logic (Acceptance Criteria)

When acceptance class is selected:

1. Read data from `standards/` (AMS, TUV, etc.).
2. Auto-populate FBH sizes, sensitivity levels, rejection thresholds.
3. Show warnings for special materials (e.g. titanium) where extra checks apply.

---

## Code Conventions

### TypeScript

- Strict TypeScript.
- Prefer `interface` for objects, `type` for unions and composition.
- Use Zod (`drizzle-zod`, `zod`) for runtime validation where needed.
- All API responses and main domain objects must be typed.

### React Components

- Functional components only.
- Use shadcn/ui patterns + Radix primitives for UI consistency.
- Co-locate component-specific hooks with the component when reasonable.
- Use a `cn()` utility for conditional Tailwind classNames.

### State Management

- React Query for server state (API data, caching).
- Local React state/context for UI state.
- Do not add extra global state libraries without explicit decision.

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hooks: `use-kebab-case.ts`
- Utils: `kebab-case.ts`
- Types: `kebab-case.types.ts`

---

## Testing Guidelines

There is currently no standardised test suite wired into `package.json`.

When adding tests:

1. Propose a test framework (e.g. Vitest / Jest / Playwright) and script name.
2. Ask before editing `package.json` and setting up the test runner.
3. Focus tests on:
   - UT standard calculations (FBH, acceptance criteria).
   - Geometry math (OD/ID/thickness, scan coverage).
   - Auto-fill logic for acceptance classes.
   - Drawing/dimension generation correctness.

Place tests in:

- `__tests__/` folders or `*.test.ts` files near the code, based on whatever pattern is introduced first.

---

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Part Type

1. Add the type to the central domain types in `shared/` (e.g. `PartType` union).
2. Extend the Zod schema(s) in `shared/` for that geometry.
3. Add or update 3D model / viewer components in `src/` (3D area).
4. Add drawing generator logic in `drawing-engine/`.
5. Update scan direction logic/hooks and UI forms accordingly.

### Adding or Updating a Standard

1. Add or update data files under `standards/` (new folder per standard if needed).
2. Type them properly in a dedicated TypeScript module.
3. Update any services in `server/` that read these standards.
4. Ensure auto-fill / validation hooks on the frontend use the new data.

---

## Performance Considerations

- 3D viewer components should use `React.memo`, `useMemo` and `useCallback` where needed.
- Large tables should be virtualised (TanStack Virtual or similar) when implemented.
- CAD and heavy drawing work should run in background tasks (`tasks/`, workers) rather than blocking the UI.
- PDF generation and large exports should avoid blocking the main React thread.

## Environment Variables (examples)

```env
DATABASE_URL=           # PostgreSQL connection string
SUPABASE_URL=           # Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=      # Supabase anonymous key
VITE_API_URL=           # API base URL for frontend
CAD_WORKER_THREADS=     # Number of CAD worker threads (default: 2)
```
