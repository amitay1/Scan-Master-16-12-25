## Contributions

### 2025-11-13 - GitHub Copilot Agent (PR #2)
**What I did:**
- Recreated this AI_CONTRIBUTIONS.md document to track all AI contributions to the project
- Created GITHUB_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md to explain why files appear in PRs before appearing in main
- Clarified that files created in PRs need to be merged to appear in the main branch
- This resolves the question "Why is the file created in a new branch and not in main?"
