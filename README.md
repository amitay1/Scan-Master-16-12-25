## Getting Started

This repository follows the standard GitHub workflow:
1. Changes are made on feature branches
2. Pull Requests are created for review
3. After approval, PRs are merged to main

See [GITHUB_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md](GITHUB_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

## Note About Pull Requests

If you see files or changes in a Pull Request but not in the main branch, this is normal! 
Files only appear in main **after** the PR is merged. 

**To merge a PR:**
1. Review the changes on the PR page
2. Click "Merge pull request"
3. Confirm the merge
